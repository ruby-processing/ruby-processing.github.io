JRubyArt is a ruby wrapper for [processing-3.0][processing].  Create processing sketches 
  in ruby using regular ruby-2.1 syntax, and use the magic [JRuby][jruby] to run them.
  You can use both rubygems and and regular processing libraries in your 
  sketches. Features run, watch and live modes (uses pry).
