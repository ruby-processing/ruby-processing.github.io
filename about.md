The ruby-processing group exists to collect together projects that support creating and running processing sketches in ruby. It is also designed to hide the inevitably high __bus factor__ of what is an essentially __one man band__, but I am trying hard to make it otherwise (including evolving the code). You could play your part...

There are two main projects [JRubyArt][jruby_art] and [propane][propane], the most evolved and tested of these is [JRubyArt][jruby_art], which is essentially a version ruby-processing that provides a ruby wrapper around the latest [vanilla processing][processing], and depends on a vanilla processing install (but can be configured to not require a jruby install). [Propane][propane] is a configuration free, standalone version of ruby-processing that depends on an installed jruby (is somewhat more experimental).

Other projects include the pbox2d gem (a gem wrapper around [jbox2d][jbox2d]), toxiclibs gem (a gem wrapper around [toxiclibs][toxiclibs]) and geomerative gem (a gem wrapper around [geomerative][geomerative]).

Not forgetting the atom editor projects [atom-k9][atom-k9] and [language-jruby-art][language]
