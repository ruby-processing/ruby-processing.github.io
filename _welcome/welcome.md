This site is the home of the ruby-processing group, which exists to collect together projects that have evolved from the original [ruby-processing][ruby-processing] see about. New members are always welcome, but preferably leave any opinionated frameworks behind, this is emphatically not a __rails project__, and does not require __bundler__, __rvm__ or __rbenv__, use these tools (crutches) locally if you must. At the simplest level there is always scope for developing spiffy new examples (ruby), but the recently created atom projects could use some love (javascript / coffeescript). To develop [JRubyArt][jruby_art] or [propane][propane] a knowledge of java and polyglot maven builds would come in handy. Knowledge of javascript/coffeescript woould be hand to improve [atom-k9][atom-k9] and [language-jruby-art][language-jruby-art] atom is fast becoming our editor of choice for JRubyArt, propane etc. In general unit testing (minitest/JUnit) is preferred to rspec etc.
