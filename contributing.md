## JRubyArt ##
In the spirit of [free software][free-sw], **everyone** is encouraged to help improve this project.

Here are some ways *you* can contribute:

* by reporting bugs
* by suggesting/implementing new features ( _package export would be cool_ )
* by writing or editing documentation ( _expert Windows users could help write install instructions_ )
* by contributing examples ( _show your creativity, or translate someone elses masterpiece_ )
* by refactoring examples to be more rubyfied
* by closing [issues][]
* by proselytizing JRubyArt (propane), we need more champions
* by supporting [Processing.org][], nothing to do with us but we rely on them
* by figuring out if we could replace swing with javafx for control_panel etc
* contributing towards `atom-k9` and `language-jruby-art` packages for atom
