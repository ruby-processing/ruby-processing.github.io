ASFAIK there isn't a book on ruby-processing, JRubyArt, or propane perhaps I should write one. There's plenty of books on processing, and some where code has been ported to ruby. If you are new to ruby there's quite a lot available (_including on line_), but if you are coming from java or processing you can learn a lot just running the examples and reading the code (__Rails__ is a terrible place to start to learn ruby).
If you're just learning to code for the first time, [learning processing with ruby][lruby] includes most of the examples from Daniel Shiffman's [Learning Processing][lprocessing], an introductory textbook (move `size` to `settings` to port to JRubyArt). Or there is the more up to date [The Nature of Code][ncode] (_more advanced topics_) also by Daniel Shiffman, and this case majority of the examples have been [ported to ruby][ncode_ruby]. Even more processing books are listed at [processing.org]. If you want get serious with ruby there's Sandi Metz's [Practical Object-Oriented Design][poodr] which should help guide you to write decent ruby code. If you fancy doing a bit of re-factoring get [Sandis latest book][99] because there are plenty of opportunities to re-factor both ruby-processing project code, and the example sketches.

Note: Nature of Code also available in [Japanese][japanese], it would cool to annotate some of the ruby examples?
