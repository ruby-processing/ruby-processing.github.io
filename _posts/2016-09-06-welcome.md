This site is the home of the ruby-processing group, which exists to support the use of processing.org jar/binaries in ruby. [JRubyArt][jruby_art] is essentially the successor to ruby-processing, that works with processing-3.2.1 and uses jruby-9.1.5.0 to provide the ruby wrapper. [Propane][propane] is an alternative `standalone` implementation of ruby-processing, that does not require any configuration or a vanilla processing install (_currently only includes opengl support for 64 bit MacOSX and linux_).

If you are a hardbaked ruby user you will likely use vim to to develop propane or JRubyArt sketches, failing that you should look at the [atom-editor][atom] and install [atom-k9][k9] and [language-jruby-art][language] packages.
