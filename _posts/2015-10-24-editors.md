### Textmate / Sublime Text
A very simple [Textmate Bundle][textmate] was created to run ruby-processing projects in textmate, which could be adapted for JRubyArt (please share your experience)

### JEdit
Alternatively install my jEdit [k9.xml][commando] commando file. Full [instructions here][jedit] to `run`/`watch` JRubyArt sketches all from the jEdit ide/editor (Windows users should be most interested in this). Can be used as `pry` editor

### Vim
Is an excellent choice for linux and mac users, commands available from vim:-
{% highlight bash %}
:!k9 run %   # will run the sketch
:!k9 live %  # to create a pry repl 
:!k9 watch % # reloads and run sketch on save
{% endhighlight %}
see [live editing with pry][pry]. 

### Emacs
Similar to vim (also works well with pry see [detailed instructions][pry]). Emacs can also be heavily [customised][emacs] use the `--emacs` flag with `k9 create` to create sketches for the customised emacs. 

### Netbeans
There is even a [plugin for NetBeans][plugin] (by the jruby guys, well probably just Tom Enebo) for the really serious. You can load the jruby_art gem from netbeans, but currently you may need a manual install of JRuby-9.1.2.0. Sketches created with the `--emacs` flag can be run from the ide.
