Here is an example sketch by Joshua Davis, from the [hype framework][hype_framework] that has been changed to make use of ruby syntax.
The declared aim of the [hype][hype_library] library is to provide:-
__A collection of classes that performs the heavy lifting so that you can create sketches with the minimum amount of code__. When using the [hype][hype_library] library to create [JRubyArt][jruby_art] sketches it is suggested that you not simply ape the [hype framework][hype_framework] examples, but tailor your sketches to take advantage of the ruby language to create even more elegant code (Code as Art). 

Unzip the library in the processing libraries folder, rename the folder `hype`, rename `distribution` folder to `library`, rename the `HYPE.jar` to `hype.jar`. Check that you can see the library from the processing-3.2.1 ide. Note that we can use snake case in place of camel case, for constants use `::` and not `.` to call. The important thing to learn from this sketch is how to implement the `HCallback` interface. This can be implemented as a closure (block), note we do not/should not try and use the vanilla processing method. 

In this case we use ruby syntax to `dry out` the creation of web colors. We first create an array of web color strings `PALETTE`. We then `map` those strings to color int values, creating the array palette.  We then use the palette in the creation of a new instance of`HColorPool`. We could make the code more literate by creating a hash of web colors (and call the colors by human readable names, although for web artists that might not be necessary)? 

From the above you should realise that it is very easy to experiment with different palettes using the JRubyArt watch mode (best to load up a few at the outset, but they could also be individually edited, because ruby constants are only constant by convention, but you will get `warned`).  Since JRubyArt-1.0.7 we can make an even more efficient conversion from an array of web string to an array of java color int using the `web_to_color_array` method, see the [nested callbacks][nested] post.
