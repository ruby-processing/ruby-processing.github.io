For ruby-processing the `--nojruby` flag (or running with jruby-complete) is required to run a number of sketches eg `shader` and `load_image`. This was true for JRubyArt before version 1.1.0, unless the `absolute path` was provided, since jruby_art-1.1.0 you can use the `data_path` wrapper to return the absolute path for the `data` folder [see here][here]. 

Introduced for processing-3.0 is the `settings` method, but this is hidden for users of the [processing ide][settings]. This is where `size` belongs or `full_screen`, also you should set `smooth` and `pixel_density` here. Retina users can make use of their hi-dpi display by setting `pixel_density(2)`, NB: size should be first line of `settings`, and if used `pixel_density(2)` should be next.
