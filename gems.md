RubyGems is a package manager for the Ruby programming language that provides a standard format for distributing Ruby programs and libraries (in a self-contained format called a "gem"), a tool designed to easily manage the installation of gems, and a server for distributing them. In the main you can use most of these gems in ruby-processing projects, though some built with native extensions may not be usable with jruby, there are usually good and sometimes better java alternatives (including [gems built for jruby][jgem]). But there's more there are [gems][gems] that have been build exclusively for use with jruby-projects, that make it even easier to use processing libraries in JRubyArt and propane. There are gems to help with maven builds, publish web-pages (_jekyll and its github flavors_) that are used to bring you this content etc.
